# Contributing to Kalaam
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev-Kalaam-NextVersion`. 
2. The setups for recreating the project have been given in the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite and build passes, by running `npm run test` and `npm run build`
<!-- 5. Make sure your code lints. -->
5. Issue that pull request!

<!-- ## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification -->

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Kalaam-Programming-Language/Kalaam/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Kalaam-Programming-Language/Kalaam/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
